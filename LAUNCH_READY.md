## 📧 First Outreach Email (Copy-Paste)

**Subject:** Built AI tool for iGaming affiliates - Want early access?

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're in the iGaming affiliate space (saw your site [website]).

I've been building an AI-powered SEO tool specifically for affiliates. After talking to 20+ iGaming affiliates, I kept hearing:

"Updating casino bonuses and odds takes forever."

So I built RankSmart - an AI that:
✅ Analyzes top-ranking competitors
✅ Generates better, SEO-optimized content
✅ Auto-monitors and updates outdated info

I'm looking for 50 beta testers. In exchange, you get lifetime Pro access FREE ($149/mo value).

Interested? Grab a spot here:
https://dannythehat.github.io/ranksmart/early-access.html

Or just reply and I'll send you a demo.

Best,
Daniel

P.S. - Here's a quick demo: https://dannythehat.github.io/ranksmart/dashboard.html
