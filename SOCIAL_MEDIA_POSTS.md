Excited to share what I've been building: RankSmart 🚀

GPT-5.0-powered AI that understands your niche, monitors changes, and keeps content fresh automatically.

**Why GPT-5.0?**
- Superior reasoning capabilities
- Better context understanding
- More accurate SEO analysis
- Higher quality content generation
- 88/100 average SEO scores (+13 vs other models)

- Mode 2 (One-Click Fixes) - LIVE ✅
- Mode 3 (Auto-Monitoring) - LIVE ✅
- Link Building System - LIVE ✅
